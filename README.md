# Rediggit

Rediggit is a flexible full-width light and darkmode theme for [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/). Lemmy is a decentralized, free, and open source link aggregator, discussion forum, and reddit alternative. Rediggit is inspired by other link aggregator services, including Reddit, Digg, Hacker News, Lobsters, and Slashdot. It is optimized for desktop use, and may not render correctly on mobile or tablet browsers.

The light and dark variants are dynamically assigned based on the client
OS and/or browser preferences for dark mode.

Both Lemmy and this theme are under rapid development. I'll do my best to push updates that are well-tested and robust.

*Note: the name for this theme will likely change in the near future*

## Installation

The easiest method of installation is to use a CSS injector browser add-on, such as Stylus ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)). Rediggit is also available natively on the [lemmy.ca](https://lemmy.ca/) instance.
