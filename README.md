# Rediggit

Rediggit is a flexible full-width theme for [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/), a decentralized, free, and open source link aggregator service and reddit alternative. It is heavily inspired by other link aggregators, including Reddit, Digg, Hacker News and others.

Both Lemmy and this theme are under rapid development. I'll do my best to only push updates that are well-tested and robust.

## Installation

The easiest method of installation is to use a CSS injector browser add-on, such as Stylus ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)). Rediggit is also available natively on the [lemmy.ca](https://lemmy.ca/) instance.
