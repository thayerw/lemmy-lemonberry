# Rediggit

Rediggit is a flexible full-width theme for [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/). Lemmy is a decentralized, free, and open source link aggregator, discussion forum, and reddit alternative. Rediggit is inspired by other link aggregator services, including Reddit, Digg, Hacker News, Lobsters, and Slashdot. It is optimized for desktop use, and may not render correctly on mobile or tablet browsers.

Both Lemmy and this theme are under rapid development. I'll do my best to push updates that are well-tested and robust.

## Installation

The easiest method of installation is to use a CSS injector browser add-on, such as Stylus ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)). Rediggit is also available natively on the [lemmy.ca](https://lemmy.ca/) instance.
