# Lemonberry

*Rediggit has been renamed to Lemonberry, to better reflect its separation from Reddit*

Lemonberry is a flexible, full-width light and dark theme for [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/), a decentralized, free, and open source link aggregator, discussion forum, and reddit alternative. Lemonberry is inspired by other link aggregator services, including Reddit, Digg, Hacker News, Lobsters, and Slashdot. It is optimized for desktop use, and may not render as gracefully on mobile or tablet browsers.

The light and dark variants are dynamically assigned based on your OS and/or browser preference for dark mode. See the stylesheet header for the currently supported Lemmy version(s).

Lemmy and Lemonberry are both under rapid development. I'll do my best to push updates that are well-tested and robust.

## Installation

The easiest method of installation is to use a CSS injector browser add-on, such as Stylus ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)).
